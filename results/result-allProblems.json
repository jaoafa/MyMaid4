  "detailsInfo": "Reports code constructs that always produce the same result, may throw exceptions, or violates nullability contracts.\n\nExamples:\n\n    if (array.length < index) {\n      System.out.println(array[index]);\n    } // Array index is always out of bounds\n\n    if (str == null) System.out.println(\"str is null\");\n    System.out.println(str.trim());\n    // the last statement may throw an NPE\n\n    @NotNull\n    Integer square(@Nullable Integer input) {\n        // the method contract is violated\n        return input == null ? null : input * input;\n    }\n\n\nThe inspection behavior may be controlled by a number of annotations, such as\n[nullability](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/nullable-and-notnull-annotations.html) annotations,\n[@Contract](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/contract-annotations.html) annotation,\n`@Range` annotation and so on.\n\nConfigure the inspection:\n\n* Use the **Suggest @Nullable annotation for methods/fields/parameters where nullable values are used** option to warn when a nullable value is passed as an argument to a method with a non-annotated parameter, stored into non-annotated field, or returned from a non-annotated method. In this case, the inspection will suggest propagating the `@Nullable` annotation. You can also configure nullability annotations using the **Configure Annotations** button.\n* Use the **Treat non-annotated members and parameters as @Nullable** option to assume that non-annotated members can be null, so they must not be used in non-null context.\n* Use the **Report not-null required parameter with null-literal argument usages** option to report method parameters that cannot be null (e.g. immediately dereferenced in the method body), but there are call sites where a `null` literal is passed.\n* Use the **Report nullable methods that always return a non-null value** option to report methods that are annotated as `@Nullable`, but always return non-null value. In this case, it's suggested that you change the annotation to `@NotNull`.\n* Use the **Don't report assertions with condition statically proven to be always true** option to avoid reporting assertions that were statically proven to be always true. This also includes conditions like `if (alwaysFalseCondition) throw new IllegalArgumentException();`.\n* Use the **Ignore assert statements** option to control how the inspection treats `assert` statements. By default, the option is disabled, which means that the assertions are assumed to be executed (-ea mode). If the option is enabled, the assertions will be completely ignored (-da mode).\n* Use the **Warn when reading a value guaranteed to be constant** option to add warnings on reading variables that contain some constant values, for example: `true`, `false`, or `null`.\n* Use the **Report problems that happen only on some code paths** option to control whether to report problems that may happen only on some code path. If this option is disabled, warnings like *exception is possible* will not be reported. The inspection will report only warnings like *exception will definitely occur*. This mode may greatly reduce the number of false-positives, especially if the code is not consistently annotated with nullability and contract annotations. That is why it can be useful for finding the most important problems in legacy code bases.",
